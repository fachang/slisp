let action A to be (lambda () (* x x)), action B to be (set! x square-of-x)
, and action C to be (set! x (+ x 1))

since action B must occur after action A, there are only three possibilities:

ABC -> x is first set to 100, then add by one, 101
ACB -> x is set to 100, action C is simply ignored, 100
CAB -> x is first add by one, then set to 121, 121
