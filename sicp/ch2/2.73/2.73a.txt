doing so makes +, * become data types. currently, the only operation
is deriv, and the operation table is as below:

       |          + |             *
------------------------------------
 deriv |  deriv-sum | deriv-product

we can't assimilate number? and same-variable? into the data-directed
dispatch because originally, number or variable data does not have their
own tag.
