part a:
    the two procedures produce the same result for every tree.
    1 3 5 7 9 11

part b:
    for procedure 1, the time complexity is given by:

    T(tree) = T(left-tree) + T(right-tree) + N(left-tree)*t

    consider a fully left biased tree. in that case, the time complexity is

    T(n) = T(n-1) + (n-1)t = t + 2t + ...+ (n-2)t + (n-1)t = O(n^2)

    for procedure 2, the time complexity is given by:

    T(tree) = T(left-tree) + T(right-tree) + t

    thus the complexity is Î˜(n).
